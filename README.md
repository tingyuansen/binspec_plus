# BinSpec++: Self-consistent binary star spectra
Tools for modeling and fitting the spectra of multiple-star systems. 

This repository builds on El-Badry's original [binspec](https://github.com/kareemelbadry/binspec) repository. In the original binspec, it only works for APOGEE dwarf stars. Here we extend the package to fitting giants also.

This [tutorial](https://github.com/tingyuansen/binspec_plus/blob/master/tutorial.ipynb) shows some simple use cases, and is only modified slightly from the original tutorial.

Please refer to the original binspec for details, and cite accordingly.
