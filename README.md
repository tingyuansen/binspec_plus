# BinSpec++: Self-consistent binary star spectra
Tools for modeling and fitting the spectra of multiple-star systems. 

## Extending to fitting for both giants and dwarfs
This repository builds on El-Badry's original [binspec][https://github.com/kareemelbadry/binspec] repository. In the original binspec, it only works for APOGEE dwarf stars. Here we try to extend the package to fitting giants also.

Please refer to the tutorial and installation guide laid out in the original binspec, and cite accordingly.
